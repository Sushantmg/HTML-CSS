  Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.
m	:centimeters
mm	:millimeters
in	:inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px *	:pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt	:points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc	:picas (1pc = 12 pt)

em	:Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
1em = 16px (default)
otherwise we have to go with parent font-size

ex	:Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
The "ex" unit is useful for typography-related sizing where you want measurements
that scale proportionally with the font size, especially for vertical spacing adjustments.

ch	:Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)
the "ch" unit is a relative length measurement based on the width 
of the "0" (zero) character in the current font

rem	:Relative to font-size of the root element
relative to parents font size 16 px

vw	:Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
"vw" stands for "viewport width" and is a relative unit 
that represents a percentage of the browser viewport's width
1vw equals 1% of the viewport width
e.g., on a 1000px wide screen, 1vw = 10px

vh	:Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
vh" stands for "viewport height" and is a relative unit that 
represents a percentage of the browser viewport's height.
1vh equals 1% of the viewport height

vmin	:Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	

vmax	:Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	

%	:Relative to the parent element
