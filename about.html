        <h1 class="about_me"> INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>I am a 20-year-old software engineering student at Gandaki College of Engineering and Science, 
            affiliated with Pokhara University. Originally from Khudi, Lamjung, I grew up in Pokhara,
             where I completed my SEE and +2 in science at Gandaki Boarding School.</p>

          <p>Academically, I have always been a dedicated and high-achieving student.
            I secured excellent grades in both SEE and +2, excelling in subjects like mathematics and computer science, 
            which further fueled my passion for technology. My ability to grasp complex concepts and apply them
             practically has set me apart throughout my academic journey. At university, I actively participate in
              coding competitions, hackathons, and technical seminars to enhance my problem-solving and software 
              development skills.</p> 

<p>From a young age, I have been captivated by technology and innovation. I thrive on solving complex problems
    through code and have a deep passion for software development. My expertise lies in front-end technologies 
    like HTML and CSS, and I am currently mastering the MERN stack at Skill Shikshya to build full-fledged web applications.
   </p>
<p>Beyond coding, I am a sports enthusiast, with basketball, football, and swimming being my go-to activities. 
    The thrill of competition and teamwork in sports translates into my approach to programmingâ€”where strategy, 
    persistence, and adaptability are key.</p>

<p>What sets me apart is my relentless curiosity and vision for the future.
    I am particularly drawn to artificial intelligence and robotics, with a strong desire to contribute to
     cutting-edge innovations. One of my dreams is to leverage my AI knowledge to work with space organizations and 
     push the boundaries of technology beyond Earth.</p>

<p>I actively engage in coding projects, constantly seeking challenges that fuel my growth. 
Whether it's developing sleek web interfaces, diving into AI and machine learning, or working 
on real-world applications, I am always eager to explore, learn, and create</p>
